Everything starts with an init.

It's a perfect time to release my new project, Moonshot Engineer, a place where I can share my learnings and my views mostly about tech, startups, software and data.

## Root cause

One thing I love the most is understanding how people works. Every project have inputs and outputs, sometimes the outputs are outstanding but what's the processes and steps to produce these outputs? How the things are made behind the hood? What was the decisions, the different proposals, the challenges, the methods, the tools and why these choices were mades?

All of these questions are hard to answer when you don't work with the team or in the company itself and that's what I want to discover, the unshared stories. One great thing is that in the software community open source is almost the root culture and that can help us to explore and understand how things are made! So it will be one of the most used channels to try to understand stories.

## Why Moonshot Engineer?

Starting a project in your bedroom or your garage and thinking about where your project will land it's something that can bring you the motivation to crush it all. But behind that it's a day to day work in a long journey and I want to see the logs of it.

## Why the moon when you can go farther?

To enjoy the earth view.
